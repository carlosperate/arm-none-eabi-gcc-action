# GitHub Action: Arm GNU Toolchain <br> (arm-none-eabi-gcc)

[![CI](https://github.com/carlosperate/arm-none-eabi-gcc-action/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/carlosperate/arm-none-eabi-gcc-action/actions/workflows/test.yml)

GitHub Action (compatible with Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms)
to download, check, set up, and cache the `arm-none-eabi-gcc` compiler
toolchain.


## Usage

Simplest way to use this action is with the default options, which uses the
the latest `arm-none-eabi-gcc` release:

```yaml
steps:
- uses: carlosperate/arm-none-eabi-gcc-action@v1
- run: arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
```

You can also specify a version (a list can be found in the
[Available releases](#available-releases) section):

```yaml
steps:
- name: Install Arm GNU Toolchain (arm-none-eabi-gcc)
  uses: carlosperate/arm-none-eabi-gcc-action@v1
  with:
    release: '13.2.Rel1' # <-- The compiler release to use
```

More information can be found in the [Advanced Options](#advanced-options)
section.


## Advantages over other options

- 🚀 Up-to-date with the latest GCC releases from Arm
- 🏎 Toolchain is cached for faster runs (reduced time from 30s-2min to 5ish seconds)
- 📅 Adds `latest` option to be able to always run tests with the latest compiler release
- ⚙️ Inputs are optional for simpler configuration
- ↗️ Toolchain path can be exported as an environmental variable and/or step output
- ✅ Downloads are MD5 checked
- ⬇️ File downloads are more stable (no random failures)
- 🐞 Issue tracker is enabled
- 🧑‍💻 Actively maintained

## Advanced options

You can use a "job matrix" to build/test your project with multiple versions
of GCC:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        gcc: ['7-2017-q4', 'latest']
    steps:
      - name: Install GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain - ${{ matrix.gcc }}
        uses: carlosperate/arm-none-eabi-gcc-action@v1
        with:
          release: ${{ matrix.gcc }}
      - run: arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
```

If you need to pass the GCC path to a different action or step the `path`
output exports it:

```yaml
- name: To access a step output, you need to provide an `id`
  uses: carlosperate/arm-none-eabi-gcc-action@v1
  id: arm-none-eabi-gcc-action
- name: The `path` to the toolchain executables can then be obtained as an output
  run: echo "The output path is ${{ steps.arm-none-eabi-gcc-action.outputs.path }}"
```

The path can also be added to an environmental variable if it's specified as
an input:

```yaml
- name: To create an environmental variable with the toolchain path provide a name via the `path-env-var` input
  uses: carlosperate/arm-none-eabi-gcc-action@v1
  with:
    path-env-var: ARM_NONE_EABI_GCC_PATH
- name: The path will be exported to that environmental variable name
  run: echo "The output path is $ARM_NONE_EABI_GCC_PATH"
```
